## Assignments

There will be a number of exercises and projects that will enhance your conceptual and technical abilities with the medium and authoring environments. These assignments will build in complexity and scope throughout the semester. The projects will require you to demonstrate your proficiency in the concepts and techniques explored during the semester.

## Quizzes

## Late Work

As a department policy the Department of Interactive Media does not accept late work. Work turned in after the posted due date will not be accepted and result in a zero (0). The instructor reserves the right to make exceptions under documented extenuating circumstances. 

## Attendance & Participation 

If you must miss class, make arrangements with the instructor prior to your absence. Assignments and quizzes missed due to an absence cannot be made up. In addition, this course requires significant commitment outside scheduled class meetings to complete the necessary work. 

Class attendance, learning, and letter grades are positively correlated. A full letter grade will be deducted with a second unexcused absence. Each subsequent unexcused absence will result in another full letter grade deduction. Two late arrivals constitute an unexcused absence.

## Academic Honesty & Authenticity 

[Bradley University’s policy](http://www.bradley.edu/campuslife/studenthandbook/policies/) as communicated in the Student Handbook will be strictly enforced. All work is to be original and completed alone and not in collaboration with others, unless otherwise specified by the assignment.

Open Source ideologies are supported and encouraged at times, however any use of code other than your own original work, including Open Source code, must be approved by the instructor before the assignment is due. 

## Policy Regarding Student Absence Due To Illness 

When missing classes and related assignments due to an illness it is the student's responsibility to visit Health Services to obtain the necessary documentation for the professor to verify the student's absence due to illness, unless the Office of the Associate Provost for Student Affairs informs the instructor of the basis for the student's absence. Instructors will not call the Health Center of any other source to verify the student's reason for absence. 

## Student Privacy
