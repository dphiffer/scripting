# Copying template files

Before we can get to the interesting part of the project, we are going to add some basic template files we can base our things off of.

## Find your template on GitHub

* Go to GitHub.com
* Look for the "Your repositories" box on the right sidebar
* Click on "exercise-3-what"

You should see two files from this week's exercise: `what.html` and `what.css`.

## Copy the HTML code

* Click on `what.html`
* Click on the __raw__ button to get text that's easier to copy/paste
* Select all of the text, and copy (⌘-C) it to your clipboard

## Create your own HTML file

Go back to the Atom text editor. 

* Choose `what.html` from the project sidebar
* Paste (⌘-V) the text you copied into the file
* Save your changes

## And the CSS file too

Go back to your web browser. If you still have the HTML code up, just press the back button twice to get back to the list of files. Otherwise, navigate there from the GitHub homepage.

* Click on `what.css`
* Click on the __raw__ button to get the raw text
* Select all of the CSS, and copy it to your clipboard
* Paste it into your `what.css` file
* Save your changes

## Commit your template files

Go back to the GitHub Desktop app.

* Write another short commit description
* Click the __Commit to master__ button
* __Sync__ your changes to GitHub
