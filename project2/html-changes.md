# HTML changes

We need to modify the HTML of our template page to include form elements allowing for user input. Weâ€™ll also want to add in the HTML that includes JavaScript onto the page.

## Change the `<h1>` prompt

* Change the contents of the `<h1>` tag. For now you can just make it: "What is going on?"

```html
<h1>What is going on?</h1>
```

## Add the form

* Replace all the text paragraphs in `what.html` with the following.

```html
<form action="what.html">

</form>
```
The form is what controls the details about how our form submits its data. In this case it's submitting to the `what.html` file.

## Add the `<textarea>`

* Add a `<textarea>` element inside the `<form>` element.

```html
<textarea name="what" id="what" placeholder="What is happening?"></textarea>
```

This will allow the user to enter text into the page.

## Add the `<script>`

* Near the bottom of your HTML, just before the `</body>` close tag, add the following.

```html
<script src="what.js"></script>
```
