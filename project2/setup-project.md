# Setting up your Atom project

Next we'll set up the Atom text editor to work with the new repository.

## Open a new project

* Launch the Atom editor and go to the menu File &rarr; Open (⌘-O)
* Find the folder where you cloned your repository, and click the __Open__ button

You should see a window, but it probably won't have any existing files to select from the project sidebar (unless you chose the options to create them from GitHub.com).

## Create new placeholder files

* Choose File &rarr; New File (⌘-N)
* Save (⌘-S) the empty file as `what.html`
* Repeat this process for `what.css` and `what.js`

You should now see three files in the project sidebar: `what.html`, `what.css`, and `what.js`.

## Commit your empty files

* Go to GitHub Desktop
* You should see your three empty files
* Write a short description (e.g., "Placeholder files")
* Click the __Commit to master__ button
* Click the __Sync__ button to upload your changes to GitHub
