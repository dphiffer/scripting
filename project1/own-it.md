# Making it your own

The last step of the project is probably the most important. Now that you have a cycling animation sequence, you can make it into whatever you want. You are going to *own it*, you get to make the project animate whatever you want.

## Adjust the speed

* Try changing the `1000` in the interval to something shorter (or longer)

## Animate different things

* Experiment with new ASCII art
* Look for [inspiration online](http://www.chris.com/ascii/)

## Try more than 3 frames

* Add more DIVs
* Change the conditional `if` to reset on a different number

## Give it a new title

* Give your animation its own name, modify the `<title>` element
* Change the names of the DIV `id` attributes
* Remember to change the JavaScript code to match the new IDs

## Finishing up

* Make sure it [validates](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* Make sure what is on GitHub.com is what you want to turn in

## Previously

* [Cycling through the frames](cycling)
