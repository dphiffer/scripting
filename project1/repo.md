# Setting up your repository

Some of these first steps may seem familiar, we will use the files we prepared earlier as a starting point.

## Download your files from GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository from last week, the URL should be something like github.com/__username__/exercise-2-duel. You can navigate to it from the GitHub.com homepage, look for "Your repositories" in the right sidebar.

* Click on the __Download ZIP__ button in the right sidebar
* Go to your __Downloads__ folder and unzip the `exercise-2-duel` zip archive by double-clicking on it
* Rename the folder to `project-1-duel`
* Move the folder to somewhere you can easily find it, such as your __Documents__ folder

## Create a new repository

* Go to __GitHub Desktop__ app, and click on the "+" icon in the top-left part of the window
* Enter `project-1-duel` as the __Name__
* Make sure the __Local Path__ matches where you saved your new folder
* Click the __Create Repository__ button

## Publish your repository

You should see your HTML file from last week, `duel1.html`, as well as the text files from the week before, `duel1.txt`, `duel2.txt`, and `duel3.txt`. We'll use the HTML file as our starting point.

* Write a brief commit description, "First commit" is fine
* Click the __Commit to master__ button

You should see your three files in the __History__ tab.

* Click on the __Publish__ button on the top right of the screen
* Enter `project-1-duel` as the repository __Name__
* Click the __Push Repository__ button to upload your files to GitHub
