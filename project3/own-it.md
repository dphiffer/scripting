# Make it your own

Think about how you might improve on this very simple wiki. Try taking it in some new direction that makes the wiki behave differently.

## Extra-credit challenges

If you feel up to the challenge, try adding one of these improvements to your tiny wiki.

* Save the values of more than one form input using `json_encode()` and `json_decode()`
* Save each iteration of the content, and allow the user to navigate to past versions (and still display the most recent one)
* Make your wiki save its updates using AJAX
