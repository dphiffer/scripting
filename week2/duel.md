# Exercise: The duel

In this exercise we are going to create a tiny ASCII art duel. Mostly this will serve as a chance to learn how to use GitHub to save things.

## Create a new repository

Before we begin to work on our ASCII art duel, we need to create a place for it to live on GitHub. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. You may need to login if you haven't already.

* Repository name: `exercise-1-duel`
* Leave everything else as-is, and click the green __Create repository__ button

You can ignore the instructions on the resulting page.

## Sign into GitHub Desktop

*Note: the next two parts assume you are using Mac OS X. If you're using a different operating system (or if your Mac doesn't support GitHub Desktop), skip this section and the next one, and follow GitHub's instructions about [how to clone your repository from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).*

* Open GitHub for desktop
* Skip the setup (close the first window that appears)
* Go to the __GitHub Desktop__ menu and choose __Preferences__
* Click on the __Accounts__ tab
* Login with your GitHub username and password

## Clone your repository

* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __Clone repository__
* Select your `exercise-1-duel` repository from the list and click the __Clone exercise-1-duel__ button
* Choose a folder to save your work, just be sure you can find it later
