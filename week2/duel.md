# Exercise: The duel

In this exercise we are going to create a tiny ASCII art duel. Mostly this will serve as a chance to learn how to use GitHub to save things.

## Create a new repository

Before we begin to work on our ASCII art duel, we need to create a place for it to live on GitHub. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. You may need to login if you haven't already.

* Repository name: `exercise-1-duel`
* Leave everything else as-is, and click the green __Create repository__ button

## Clone your repository

*Note: this part assumes you are using a Mac. If you're using a different operating system, please refer to these instructions about how to clone your repository from the command line.*

* Open GitHub for desktop
* Skip the setup (close the first window that appears)
* Go to the __GitHub Desktop__ menu and choose __Preferences__
* Click on the __Accounts__ tab
* Login with your GitHub username and password
