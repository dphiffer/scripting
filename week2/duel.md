# Exercise: The duel

In this exercise we are going to create a tiny ASCII art duel. Mostly this will serve as a chance to learn how to use GitHub to save things.

## Create a new repository

Before we begin to work on our ASCII art duel, we need to create a place for it to live on GitHub. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. You may need to login if you haven't already.

* Repository name: `exercise-1-duel`
* Leave everything else as-is, and click the green __Create repository__ button

You can ignore the instructions on the resulting page.

## Sign into GitHub Desktop

*Note: the next two parts assume you are using Mac OS X. If you're using a different operating system (or if your Mac doesn't support GitHub Desktop), skip this section and the next one, and follow GitHub's instructions about [how to clone your repository from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).*

* Open GitHub for desktop
* Skip the setup (close the first window that appears)
* Go to the __GitHub Desktop__ menu and choose __Preferences__
* Click on the __Accounts__ tab
* Login with your GitHub username and password

## Clone your repository

* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __Clone repository__
* Select your repository from the list and click the __Clone exercise-1-duel__ button
* Choose a folder to save your work, just be sure you can find it later

## Set up Atom editor

* Open the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __Open__ *(or use the keyboard shortcut ⌘-O)*
* Navigate to the folder you chose earlier, select the __exercise-1-duel__ folder and click the __Open__ button

You should see an empty project window with a sequence of tips about keyboard shortcuts.

## Create a new file

* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __New File__ *(or use the keyboard shortcut ⌘-N)*
* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __Save__
* Give your empty file the name `duel1.txt` and save it into your `exercise-1-duel` folder

You should see a new entry for `duel1.txt` appear in the project sidebar.

## Copy from the page

* Select the dueling stick figures shown below
* Copy the text to your clipboard with the keyboard shortcut __⌘-C__

```

~O  O~
<|/\|>
 |\ |\

```

## Paste into your new file

* Go back to the Atom editor
* Paste the contents of your clipboard with the keyboard shortcut __⌘-V__
* Save your file with the keyboard shortcut __⌘-S__

You may notice a little blue dot disappear from the tab, indicating you no longer have unsaved changes.

* Go to the GitHub Desktop app
