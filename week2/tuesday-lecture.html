# Week 1: Plain Text
## Or: *what do cows think about?*

---

# Text Editor

* For writing code rather than styling essays
*	Raw text, unlike binary, .rtf, .pdf, .doc, etc.
*	What is a text file? What is character encoding?
* For this class we'll use the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/)

---

# Command line

* Type instructions *directly* into your computer
* Control computers remotely
* Install weird new software (fortune, cowsay, cowthink)
* Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install new command line tools

---

# git

* Written by Linus Tarvalds to manage the Linux kernel source code
* Commands: clone, add, commit, push
* Merging and conflict resolution

---

# GitHub

* Social software for plain text
* Built around git, adding easy forking and pull requests
* Probably more important than LinkedIn and Facebook
