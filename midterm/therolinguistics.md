# Midterm: *Therolinguistics*

Due: *Tuesday, 10/20 before 11am CT.*

We are rounding out the first half of the semester with an open-ended midterm project. Start by reading Ursula K. Le Guin’s [The Author of the Acacia Seeds](http://interconnected.org/home/more/2007/03/acacia-seeds.html). That text will be our inspiration for creating a new website that might be of interest to the field of *Therolinguistics*.

## Wait, what?

To be more clear, your assignment is to read Le Guin’s story, and create a self-contained website in the spirit of her story; that it might have been written *by a non-human author* (or authors, plural). It is up to you how much you want to reveal about the nature of the website’s authorship, but that is the one constraint the project should be built around.

## Requirements

Your concept and approach will be considered above other factors, but take this as an opportunity to demonstrate the range of things we’ve covered throughout the semester so far. Express your idea through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, through page layout, mobile-first design. use jQuery and AJAX if you find them helpful. Take advantage of the writing center to refine your text. Ultimately, though, the success of your project will depend on your concept, and its expression through web technology.

## Use GitHub

Please commit often, and keep track your progress as you work. When you feel ready to turn in your midterm, use the sidebar checkbox interface on the course website to create a copy of the site.
