# Project 1: *The Duel*

We have prepared and trained in our first two exercises, and now we are ready for our ASCII duel! This is the first of six projects, which are slightly more involved compared to exercises. The project is broken into the following steps:

* Setting up your repository
* Validating your HTML
* Setting up the CSS
* Cycling through the frames
* Making it your own

Let's get started!
