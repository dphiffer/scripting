# Project 2: *What?*

We have practiced our writing skills, and gotten some feedback from the writing center. Now we will make a simple web-based tool to write new texts. We will do so in the pattern of a [single-serving website](http://kottke.org/08/02/single-serving-sites). Ours will be interactive, it will let the user type their own texts, and then easily link to that text.
