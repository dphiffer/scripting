# Setting up your Atom project

Next we'll set up the Atom text editor to work with the new repository.

## Open a new project

* Launch the Atom editor and go to the menu File &rarr; Open (⌘-O)
* Find the folder where you cloned your repository, and click the __Open__ button

You should see a window, but it probably won't have any existing files to select from the project sidebar (unless you chose the options to create them from GitHub.com).

## Create a new placeholder file

* Choose File &rarr; New File (⌘-N)
* Save (⌘-S) the empty file as `wiki.php`

You should now see your new file in the project sidebar: `wiki.php`

## Commit your empty file

* Go to GitHub Desktop
* You should see your empty file
* Write a short description (e.g., "Placeholder file")
* Click the __Commit to master__ button
* Click the __Sync__ button to upload your changes to GitHub
