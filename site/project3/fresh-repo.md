# Fresh repository

We are going to start with an empty repository.

## Create a new repository

* Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to create a new repository. (If you get a 404 page, that just means you need to login to GitHub with your username and password.)

* Repository name: `project-3-wiki`
* Leave everything else as-is, and click the green __Create repository__ button

## Clone the repository

Open the GitHub Desktop app.

* Go to the __File__ menu and choose __Clone repository__
* Select your repository from the list and click the __Clone project-3-wiki__ button
* Choose a folder to save your work, __Documents__ for example, just be sure you can find it later
